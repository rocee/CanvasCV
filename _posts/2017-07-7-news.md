Some more information about this library on the web.

For first impressions I added this link in the screenshots area
[youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjCGTdyMUkk&list=PLf8XPecJ27DYm1T-dxqwTwS-9Wd1kBKeK "Youtube playlist").

There is a new blog post about this library on my "the impossible code"
[blog](https://www.theimpossiblecode.com/blog/opencv-gui-canvascv/ "theimpossiblecode.com") .

Cheers,  
Sagi.
