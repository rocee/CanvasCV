title: Proudly launching version 1.0.0
---

Hi everyone,
We're happy to announce CanvasCV version 1.0.0 is ready for use.
It is the product of a considerable hard work and testing.
We can verify it works great on both Linux and Windows based systems.

With CanvasCV it is now very easy to create beauitful shapes and widgets
while using OpenCV.

If you're using OpenCV 3.1.0 and above, then give it a try - you'll
never go back to using the console!

What is it?
----------
* A non intrusive, simple and extendable OpenCV GUI system, based on OpenCV.
* Enables a user interface with interactive GUI without any external GUI toolkit dependencies.
* Get geomertical user selections and landmark configuration with shapes.
* Use simple widgets to interact with the user.

What makes it unique?
--------------------
* Easily extendable - create your own Shapes, Widgets and Themes and share them with others (i.e. on GitHub) if you want.
* The X/Y coordination system is the same as the OpenCV coordination system. This way, if you detect someting at a position, you can start showing
some Text at that exact postion, or if you want the user to mark someting on the image, you get back the usable coordinates from the shape.
* No external dependencies - **your code is compatible to all OpenCV environments**.
* Fully documented with examples and tutorials.

Cheers,  
Sagi.
